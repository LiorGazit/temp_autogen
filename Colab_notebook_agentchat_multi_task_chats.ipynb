This new interface allows one to pass multiple tasks and their corresponding dedicated agents. Once initiate_chats is invoked, the tasks will be solved sequentially, with the summaries from previous tasks provided to subsequent tasks as context, if the `summary_method` argument is specified.\n",

            "Have you ever felt like you were on a wild rollercoaster ride while tracking the stock market? Well, the recent performance of tech giant NVIDIA (NVDA) and electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (TSLA) is a prime example of the thrilling ups and downs investors have experienced lately. With NVDA soaring by +29.29% and TSLA dipping by -5.12% in the past month, it's time to delve deeper into the realm of finance and investigate the forces at play driving these stock prices.\n",
            "\n",
            "NVIDIA, known for its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) and dominance in the semiconductor industry, has been riding a wave of success lately. The company's stock price surge can be attributed to a myriad of factors. Firstly, NVIDIA's strong earnings report showcasing robust revenue growth and profitability has captured the attention of investors. Additionally, the company's expansion into artificial intelligence, data centers, and autonomous driving technology has fueled optimism among analysts and market observers. With the increasing demand for GPUs in various sectors, NVIDIA seems poised for continued growth and innovation.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the other hand, Tesla, the trailblazer in the electric vehicle (EV) market, has faced some headwinds in recent weeks. The company's stock price decline may be partly due to concerns over supply chain disruptions impacting EV production and delivery timelines. Moreover, regulatory challenges and competition in the EV space have also put pressure on Tesla's stock performance. Despite these setbacks, Tesla remains a key player in the EV market, with a loyal customer base and ambitious plans for expansion and innovation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Analyzing the broader market trends and industry developments, we see a dynamic landscape shaping the fortunes of NVDA and TSLA. The tech sector's resilience and growth potential have attracted investors seeking high-growth opportunities, benefiting companies like NVIDIA. On the other hand, the EV industry's rapid evolution and regulatory uncertainties have added volatility to Tesla's stock price.\n",
            "\n",
            "As we navigate the turbulent waters of the stock market, it's crucial to consider the insights and recommendations of financial analysts. Their assessments of companies like NVIDIA and Tesla can provide valuable perspectives on future performance and investment opportunities. While past performance is not indicative of future outcomes, analyzing market trends and company fundamentals can help investors make informed decisions in a fast-paced and ever-changing market environment.\n",
